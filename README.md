# CRM Frontend with Angular 

This project project uses Angular as frontend and Spring boot as backend to create a Customer-Relationship-Manager Project.


# HOW TO TEST IT
1. Download docker-compose.yml file
2. Make sure port 3306, 8080 and 4200 are not used by any other application. (If you have a database running, it will be using 3306. Make
        sure to stop it)
3. Open terminal, and change to the directory where your downloaded docker-compose.yml file is located.
4. Run the command in the terminal: docker-compose up -d
5. The application is running. Now, go to any brower like google chrome, and hit the url http://localhost:4200
6. You are ready to check the app. Thank you.
